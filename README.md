## NFC Media Center

NMC is a media center designed to provide a cheap alternative to expensive NFC based music players like the yoto mini. It is currently pr-alpha. 

### Hardware Setup

Currently I'm running this on a Raspberry Pi 3b. If you have a similar setup with the same PN532 v3 sensor you can simply run the ./installnfc.sh script to get setup on a
clean install. However, this assumes you have the same wiring, protocol and dip switch positions. Currently I do not have graphics for this. I'm not expecting much interest yet so if you want to try it yourself please open an issue so I know that you would like me to complete the setup details. 

### Software Setup

I prefer to be on the latest versions. Currently my local environment is running.  
```
node --version  
v21.5.0
npm --version
10.2.5
```

Note: vlc can be run with cvlc to runwithout the interface.

This is all that's needed at the moment, however it is likely that VLC and additional software dependencies will be required to make things work correctly.
